Description:
    This packages collects useful extensions, missing functions and common
    recipes missing from the 'stringr' package. It closely follows 'stringr'
    conventions, depends on 'stringr' and can therefore serve as a
    drop-in replacement.
Depends:
     stringr (>= 1.0.0)
Suggests:
     testthat (>= 0.10.0),
     knitr (>= 1.13)
